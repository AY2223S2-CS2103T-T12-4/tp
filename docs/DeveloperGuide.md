## **Introduction**

This Developer Guide serves as documentation of the **[architecture](#architecture)** and **[design](#design)** of **SOCket**, an application for managing contacts and projects, with some key **[implementation](#implementation)** details of SOCKet's features. The current version of SOCket is `v1.3`.

The Developer Guide is written to aid present and future developers of SOCket with understanding the architecture, design and non-trivial implementations of SOCket's features. In doing so, this guide imparts the knowledge required for developers to further modify and extend the features and functionality of SOCket beyond its current state.

The code for SOCket is hosted on GitHub **[here](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T12-4/tp)**.

Refer to the following section for how to **[set up and get started](#setting-up-getting-started)** with SOCket.

### Architecture

<p align="center"><img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" /></p>

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T12-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/socket/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T12-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/socket/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The ***Sequence Diagram*** below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<p align="center"><img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" /></p>

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<p align="center"><img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" /></p>

The sections below give more details of each component.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T12-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/socket/ui/Ui.java)

Shown below is the class diagram for the `UI` component:

<p align="center"><img src="images/UiClassDiagram.png" /></p>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T12-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/socket/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T12-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` and `Project` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T12-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/socket/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<p align="center"><img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/></p>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `SocketParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

<p align="center"><img src="images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png" /></p>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<p align="center"><img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/></p>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `SocketParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `SocketParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Model component
The **API** of this component is specified in [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T12-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/socket/model/Model.java)

Shown below is the class diagram for the `Model` component:

<p align="center"><img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="800" /></p>

The `Model` component,

* stores the `Socket` data, i.e., all `Person` objects (contained in a `UniquePersonList` object) and all `Project` objects (contained in a `UniqueProjectList` object).
* stores the `VersionedSocket` data, i.e., `Socket` states to restore, either to `undo` or `redo` changes
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores the `Project` objects as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Project>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has `Language` and `Tag` lists in `Socket`, which `Person` references. This allows `Socket` to only require one `Language`/`Tag` object per unique language/tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Language`/`Tag` objects.<br>

<p align="center"><img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" /></p>

</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Storage component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T12-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/socket/storage/Storage.java)

Shown below is the class diagram for the `Storage` component:

<p align="center"><img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" /></p>

The `Storage` component,
* can save both `Socket` data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* can save data on `Person` members of a `Project` and restore references to same `Person` objects in `UniquePersonList` upon reading `Socket` data back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `SocketStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`).

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.socket.commons` package.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Undo/Redo feature

#### Implementation

_This feature was implemented as proposed in [AddressBook-Level3](https://se-education.org/addressbook-level3/DeveloperGuide.html#proposed-undoredo-feature)_

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedSocket`. It extends `Socket` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `socketStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedSocket#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current 'Socket' state in its history.
* `VersionedSocket#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous 'Socket' state from its history.
* `VersionedSocket#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone 'Socket' state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitSocket()`, `Model#undoSocket()` and `Model#redoSocket()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedSocket` will be initialized with the initial `Socket` state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single `Socket` state.

<p align="center"><img src="images/UndoRedoState0.png" /></p>

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in 'Socket'. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitSocket()`, causing the modified state of `Socket` after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `socketStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted `Socket` state.

<p align="center"><img src="images/UndoRedoState1.png" /></p>

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitSocket()`, causing another modified `Socket` state to be saved into the `socketStateList`.

<p align="center"><img src="images/UndoRedoState2.png" /></p>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitSocket()`, so the `Socket` state will not be saved into the `socketStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoSocket()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous `Socket` state, and restores `Socket` to that state.

<p align="center"><img src="images/UndoRedoState3.png" /></p>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial `Socket` state, then there are no previous `Socket` states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoSocket()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

<p align="center"><img src="images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png" /></p>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoSocket()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores `Socket` to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `socketStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest `Socket` state, then there are no undone `Socket` states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoSocket()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the `Socket`, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitSocket()`, `Model#undoSocket()` or `Model#redoSocket()`. Thus, the `socketStateList` remains unchanged.

<p align="center"><img src="images/UndoRedoState4.png" /></p>

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitSocket()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `socketStateList`, all `Socket` states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

<p align="center"><img src="images/UndoRedoState5.png" /></p>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<p align="center"><img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" /></p>


#### Design considerations

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire `Socket`.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### List Feature 

#### Implementation

The `list` feature allows user to display a list of persons. The user can filter the list by tag or language. `list` filters the list by **AND** search. If no argument is given, then list by default displays all persons in SOCket. 
The feature is mainly facilitated by the `ListCommand` class and with the help of Predicate classes. 
`ListCommand` extends `Command` and implements the following operation: 
* `ListCommand#execute()` - Displays the list of persons in SOCket that contains the given keyword of each respective fields. 

The `ListCommandParser` class is used to parse and verify the user input to create the list command. 
Once the input is parsed by `ListCommandParser`, a list of keywords for each respective field is then used to create the respective Predicate class to check if any keyword matches the given field of a Person. 

The Predicates relevant to `ListCommand` differ from `FindCommand` in the way that it looks for full keyword matches in Person(s). If no fields are given, list of persons will be update by `PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_PERSONS`/ a true predicate. 
Otherwise, this list of Predicate classes include: 
* `ListCommandLanguagePredicate`
* `ListCommandTagPredicate`

This Predicate class will return True as long as any of the Predicate classes inside it returns True.
The Predicate classes works using an AND search, persons will be shown in the resulting list only if all the keywords given should match to the Person. 

The following sequence diagram shows how the `list` operation works:
<p align="center"><img src="images/ListSequenceDiagram.png" /></p>


#### Design considerations

**Aspect: Filtering by other fields** 

* Initially considered list to not have additional arguments but as decided to filter through Language and Tag due to:
  * Find currently does a partial keyword match, thus list allows user to have the option to do full keyword matches 
  * As language(s) and tag(s) are the only fields which can belong to more than one person, it makes sense to use list to do full keyword matches on these fields only.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Sort Feature

#### Implementation

The sort feature allows users to sort the list of persons and projects in the application. 
The feature is facilitated by the `SortCommand` and `SortProjectCommand` classes. 
They extend `Command` and implements the following operations:
* `SortCommand#execute()`â€‰â€”â€‰Sorts the list of persons in the application.
* `SortProjectCommand#execute()`â€‰â€”â€‰Sorts the list of projects in the application.

The `SortCommandParser` and `SortProjectCommandParser` classes are used to parse the user input and create the respective commands. 
The respective classes verify that the user input is valid and create the commands accordingly.
If no argument is provided, Persons will be sorted by name and Projects will be sorted by deadline by default.

The input is then passed to the `sort` function in `UniquePersonList` and `UniqueProjectList` respectively.
The `sort` makes use of a comparator that sorts the persons or projects by the category specified by the user. 
If the person or project does not have that field, they are sorted at the back. If there are multiple persons or contacts where the field is empty, they are sorted by name.

The following sequence diagram shows how the sort operation works for persons (implementation is similar for projects):
<p align="center"><img src="images/SortSequenceDiagram.png" /></p>


<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Find Feature

#### Implementation

The find feature allows users to display a list of persons that contains the given keyword of each respective fields.
The feature is facilitated by the `FindCommand` class mainly but Predicate classes are also used.
`FindCommand` extends `Command` and implements the following operation:
* `FindCommand#execute()`â€‰â€”â€‰Finds and displays the list of persons in the application that contains the given keyword of each respective fields.

The `FindCommandParser` class is used to parse & verify the user input to create the find command.
Once the input is parsed by `FindCommandParser`, a list of keywords for each respective field is then used to create a Predicate class that checks if any keyword matches the given field of a Person.

This list of Predicate classes include:
* `FindCommandAddressPredicate`
* `FindCommandEmailPredicate`
* `FindCommandLanguagePredicate`
* `FindCommandNamePredicate`
* `FindCommandPhonePredicate`
* `FindCommandProfilePredicate`
* `FindCommandTagPredicate`

All the above Predicate classes will be enclosed inside a `FindCommandPersonPredicate` class.
This Predicate class will return True as long as any of the Predicate classes inside it returns True.
The Predicate classes works using an OR search, as long as a keyword matches any word in the respective field, that person will be shown in the resulting list from find command.

If no argument is provided, an empty list will be shown.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: AND search or OR search**
* An AND search has been considered for find initially but ultimately dropped in favor of OR search due to the following reasons:
  * List command already does an AND search. Though only on Tag & Language currently, it can be extended to include the other fields eventually, making find a duplicate command of list command should find use AND search as well.
  * We intend for find command to be a more broad search, getting all persons that matches just a keyword. This is to help users narrow down their search should they forgot the exact name of a contact they are looking for.

**Aspect: Full keyword match or Partial keyword match**
* We have also considered a partial match of the keyword (For example: `han` keyword will match field with the value `hans`). However we decide to implement a full match due to the following reason:
  * Having partial match may bring out unintended matches as the possible range of results is broadened. We fear that doing a partial match may be too broad for find command to function as a way for users to narrow down their search.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Remove Feature

#### Implementation

The remove feature allows users to remove a given value in Person's and Project's respective fields.
The feature is facilitated by the `RemoveCommand` class and `RemoveProjectCommand` classes.
They extend `Command` and implement the following operations:
* `RemoveCommand#execute()` â€‰â€”â€‰Removes the respective Person's field value based on the given input.
* `RemoveProjectCommand#execute()` â€‰â€”â€‰Removes the respective Project's field value based on the given input.

The `RemoveCommandParser` and `RemoveProjectCommandParser` classes are used to parse the user input and remove the value that matches to the existing value in the respective field using `RemovePersonDescriptor` and `RemoveProjectDescriptor` respectively.
`RemovePersonDescriptor` and `RemoveProjectDescriptor` objects are created and pass with the `Index` (parsed from the user input) into respective commands.
The respective classes verify that the user input is valid and create the commands accordingly.

If no argument is provided, an exception will be thrown. Otherwise, if only predicate is present, the corresponding field of the Person/Project will be emptied.

#### Design considerations

**Remove a specific field value**
* While an edit feature that allows users to add or remove field values can be useful in certain contexts, it may not be appropriate or necessary in all situations:
    * If user decides to remove 1 out of many field values in a person's tag field, user will have a difficult time to type all the must-have value. WIth remove feature, user just need to type out the tag that he/she wish to remove.
    * Currently, edit feature for language field is cumulative, language will not be removed, so remove feature helps to resolve the issue on language removal.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Project feature:

#### Implementation

This feature allows users to create and track ongoing projects. Details of each `Project` are recorded as attributes of the `Project`, which include `ProjectName`, `ProjectRepoHost`, `ProjectRepoName`, `ProjectDeadline`, `ProjectMeeting`, and a `Set<Person>`, which stores the `Person` objects involved with the `Project`. `Project` objects are stored in a `UniqueProjectList` in `Socket`.

Any changes to `Person` objects that are associated with a `Project` object automatically updates the outdated `Person` object in the associated `Project` object (i.e., `edit`, `remove`, `delete`).

The following sequence diagram shows how updates are made to the associated `Project` object when updates are made to `Person` objects on execution of a `DeleteCommand`:

<p align="center"><img src="images/UpdateProjectOnDeletePersonSequenceDiagram.png" /></p>

Step 1. The `DeleteCommand#execute()` method is called.

Step 2. The `ModelManager#deletePerson(p)` method of the `ModelManager` implementing the `Model` interface is then called.

Step 3. This calls the method `Socket#removePerson(p)`, which:

* calls `UniquePersonList#remove(p)` to delete the person `p` from the `UniquePersonList` `persons`.
* calls `UniqueProjectList#removeMemberInProjects(p)` which removes any stored references to the deleted person `p` from the `Project` objects in the `UniqueProjectList` `projects`.

Step 4. The execution of the `DeleteCommand` then continues, and the result is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` (not shown) and returned.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The diagram omits the `commitSocket()` and creation of a `CommandResult` portions of the execution as they are not relevant to the discussion.
</div>

Updates to `Person` objects associated with a `Project` object through the other commands are handled similarly.

The following classes handle operations on `Project` objects:
* `XYZProjectCommand` - represents a command operating on `Project` objects, i.e., `AddProjectCommand`, `EditProjectCommand`, etc.
* `XYZProjectCommandParser` - parses the respective `XYZProjectCommand` that operates on `Project` objects.
* `AssignCommand`, `UnassignCommand` - represent commands for assigning/unassigning a `Person` object to a `Project` object.

The `JsonAdaptedProject` class handles the reading/writing to storage for `Project` objects. It makes use of `JsonAdaptedPerson` to store the `Person` objects associated with the `Project`. Storage for `Person` objects associated with a `Project` object are stored in the `.json` file by making a copy of the data for the `Person` in the "persons" list in the "members" list under the respective `Project` object in the "projects" list.

When `JsonSerializableSocket#toModelType` is called to convert the stored data into a `Socket` object, the restored `Person` objects in the `UniquePersonList` are matched to the duplicate `Person` objects in the `Project` objects and the duplicate `Person` objects are replaced with the exiting objects in the `UniquePersonList`.

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How `Project` objects are stored:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Stores the `Project` objects with the `Person` objects in a single `.json` file.
    * Pros: Fewer files to manage, simpler to write data to upon any changes to `Socket`.
    * Cons: Corrupt data in "projects" will cause entire file to be discarded, deleting "persons" data.

* **Alternative 2:** Stores the `Project` objects with the `Person` objects in separate `.json` files.
    * Pros: Corrupt data in "projects" will only cause "projects" file to be discarded.
    * Cons: More files to manage, harder to write data to upon any changes to `Socket`.
