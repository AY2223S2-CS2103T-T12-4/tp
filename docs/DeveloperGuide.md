### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T12-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/socket/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T12-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/socket/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T12-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/socket/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T12-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/socket/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T12-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T12-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/socket/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `SocketParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `SocketParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `SocketParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T12-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/socket/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the `Socket` data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `Socket`, which `Person` references. This allows `Socket` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T12-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/socket/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both 'Socket' data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `SocketStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.socket.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Undo/redo feature

This feature was implemented as proposed in [AddressBook-Level3](https://se-education.org/addressbook-level3/DeveloperGuide.html#proposed-undoredo-feature) 

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedSocket`. It extends `Socket` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `socketStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedSocket#commit()` — Saves the current 'Socket' state in its history.
* `VersionedSocket#undo()` — Restores the previous 'Socket' state from its history.
* `VersionedSocket#redo()` — Restores a previously undone 'Socket' state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitSocket()`, `Model#undoSocket()` and `Model#redoSocket()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedSocket` will be initialized with the initial `Socket` state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single `Socket` state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in 'Socket'. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitSocket()`, causing the modified state of `Socket` after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `socketStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted `Socket` state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David …​` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitSocket()`, causing another modified `Socket` state to be saved into the `socketStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitSocket()`, so the `Socket` state will not be saved into the `socketStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoSocket()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous `Socket` state, and restores `Socket` to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial `Socket` state, then there are no previous `Socket` states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoSocket()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the opposite — it calls `Model#redoSocket()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores `Socket` to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `socketStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest `Socket` state, then there are no undone `Socket` states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoSocket()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the `Socket`, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitSocket()`, `Model#undoSocket()` or `Model#redoSocket()`. Thus, the `socketStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitSocket()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `socketStateList`, all `Socket` states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David …​` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire `Socket`.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

### Sort Feature
The sort feature allows users to sort the list of persons and projects in the application. 
The feature is facilitated by the `SortCommand` and `SortProjectCommand` classes. 
They extend `Command` and implements the following operations:
* `SortCommand#execute()` — Sorts the list of persons in the application.
* `SortProjectCommand#execute()` — Sorts the list of projects in the application.

The `SortCommandParser` and `SortProjectCommandParser` classes are used to parse the user input and create the respective commands. 
The respective classes verify that the user input is valid and create the commands accordingly.
If no argument is provided, Persons will be sorted by name and Projects will be sorted by deadline by default.

The input is then passed to the `sort` function in `UniquePersonList` and `UniqueProjectList` respectively.
The `sort` makes use of a comparator that sorts the persons or projects by the category specified by the user. If the person or project does not have that field, they are sorted at the back. If there are multiple persons or contacts where the field is empty, they are sorted by name.

### Find Feature
The find feature allows users to display a list of persons that contains the given keyword of each respective fields.
The feature is facilitated by the `FindCommand` class mainly but Predicate classes are also used.
`FindCommand` extends `Command` and implements the following operation:
* `FindCommand#execute()` — Finds and displats the list of persons in the application that contains the given keyword of each respective fields.

The `FindCommandParser` class is used to parse & verify the user input and create the find command.
Once the input is parsed by `FindCommandParser`, a list of keywords for each respective field is then used to create a Predicate class that checks if any keyword matches the given field of a Person.

This list of Predicate classes include:
* ``

If no argument is provided, an empty list will be shown.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

* has a need to manage a significant number of contacts (peers, professors in NUS Computing)
* has a need to group and manage groups of contacts
* has a need to view the skills and proficiencies of contacts (programming languages, modules)
* has a need to access the GitHub profiles/repositories of contacts
* has a need to track deadlines and responsibilities associated with contacts
* prefer desktop apps over other types
* can type fast
* prefers typing to mouse interactions
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

**Value proposition**: manage contacts faster than a typical mouse/GUI driven app, store information relevant to NUS Computing students (GitHub profile, repository, programming language proficiencies, modules taken), quickly find contacts that satisfy certain criteria (taken a particular module, in a group)
