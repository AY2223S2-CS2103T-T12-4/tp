### Project: SOCket

SOCket is a desktop address book application used for teaching Software Engineering principles. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

* **Project management**:
    * Create issues when things are needed to be refined

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
    * Updated `clear` command to allow users to remove group of contacts associated with the given tag(s).
    * Updated the restriction on the number of tags associated to each contact to prevent misuse of the feature.
    * Improved the UI in `HelpWindow` by categorising commands into different subgroups so that users can look for the command guide easily. 
    * Improved the UI and UX in `MainWindow`
      * Reallocated the result display and command box from the top of the application to the bottom as it allows for a more natural and intuitive user flow, with the display panel at the top.
      * Seperated the contact display into 2 components, contact list panel and contact detail panel, using split panel. Contact list displays minimal information while contact detail panel displays all the information related to the contact.
      * Improved the contact list by allowing users to click on the card and displays contact detail of the contact in contact detail panel.
      * Improved contact card by automatically wrapping tags based on the width of the contact card.
      * Improved the shape of the display card from sharp to round edges, so that the overall aesthetic of the application is enhanced. The round edges create a smoother and more polished look which help to soften the visual impact of the display card, which can give the impression of a more refined and elegant design.
      * Implemented a hover effect on contact list so that users can quickly identify which elements on the page are interactive and clickable.

* **Documentation**:
    * User Guide:
        * Added documentation for the feature `remove`, `clear`, `clearpj`, `view`
        * Added screenshot to `add`, `edit`, `remove`, `find`, `sort`, `addpj`, `editpj`, `removepj`, `sortpj`, `assign`, `unassign` and `help` command
    * Developer Guide:
        * Added use cases `UC06`, `UC13`, `UC15`
        * Update UI class diagram
